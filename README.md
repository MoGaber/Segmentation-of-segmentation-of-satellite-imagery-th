# Segmentation-of-satellite-imagery

A project for the company Satellogic. 

The goal of the project to construct a machine learning model to perform segmentation on data obtained from satellites that contains static and dynamic airplanes. The model is supposed to detect and construct segmentation boxes around all planes in the images.
